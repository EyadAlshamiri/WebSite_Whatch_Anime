            unwittingly begins to meet with Ya Mada, who comes to secretly eat her beloved sweets. Through 
            their interactions, Ishikawa discovers how messy Yamada is, and can't help but support her from 
            the side. Meanwhile, Ya Mada can't help but... While she mercilessly teases Ichikawa for his 
            confused reactions to a series of warm, everyday interactions, a bond between the two grows into 
            something more than just library acquaintances. Perhaps over time, Ichikawa will realize that his 
            desires to kill have turned into something else entirely.

            The magical kingdom of Clairod summons hundreds of heroes from other worlds every year to fight in their war

            the royal capital of Paloma, but something is not as it should be. Panaza is just an ordinary merchant who has 
            no magic, no fighting ability, and his magical condition is poor. And what's worse is that an unfortunate accident 
            leaves him unable to return to his hometown after he was rejected as a hero and stranded in another world and left 
            outside the kingdom by a cruel king who wants him gone. It only shows us that Banaza's fate is very dark, but what 
            will happen when the failed heroic candidate finds this... Himself with cheating abilities once he reaches level 2?

            Ten years ago, the “Portal” appeared and connected the real world with the magic kingdom and monsters. 
            To fight these bad monsters, ordinary people gained supernatural powers and became known as “Hunters.” 
            Twenty-year-old Song Jin-Woo is one of those hunters, but he is known as the "Weakest in the World", 
            due to his pathetic strength being paltry even compared to an E-rank. However, he hunts monsters non-stop 
            in low-rank portals to pay his mother's bills. However, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo 
            wakes up believing that he is the only person left who died in a mission that went wrong. While in the 
            hospital three days later, he finds a mysterious screen floating in front of him that requires this mission 
            to be completed Jin-Woo is given an unrealistic and intense training program, or face punishment. At first 
            Jin-Woo is reluctant to agree due to the rigor of the mission, and soon finds that it may turn him into one 
            of the most feared hunters in the world.
